Essential PH-1 (mata) FAQ
=================================================

* You want fastboot up and running. Don't even attempt any of this if you don't.
* Back to stock thread on xda: https://forum.xda-developers.com/essential-phone/development/stock-7-1-1-nmj20d-t3701681
* If your fingerprint reader stopped working, chances are you have a firmware mismatch. Typically checking your build.prop for the build version and flashing the matching firmware package will fix this. Firmware packages here: https://mega.nz/#F!oK5yWL4L!QDDxwvhePaJZ9hjdZcDvYA
* Bootloader can be unlocked via ``fastboot flashing unlock`` THIS WILL WIPE YOUR DATA
* You probably want to ``fastboot flashing unlock_critical`` while you're at it. This allows updating firmware partitions through fastboot.
* The boot partitions on this device (boot_a and boot_b) are not your "traditional" boot partitions. On these, they contain a kernel and ramdisk like you're probably used to, but in this case the ramdisk is actually your recovery. The device uses a "system-as-root" layout where the system partition actually contains what would have been in your ramdisk.
* In addition to the "system-as-root" layout, we also have the new A/B partition scheme (as first seen on the Pixel/Pixel XL). This can be quite confusing to users as there are actually two copies of many of the partitions. The idea of "slots" comes in to play to determine which set of partitions you are booting. In our case we have an "a" slot and a "b" slot. To determine which slot you are currently booting, you can issue this command via adb: ``adb shell getprop ro.boot.slot_suffix`` or via fastboot: ``fastboot getvar current-slot``. This slot can be changed via fastboot: ``fastboot set_active [a,b]`` or swapped to the non-current slot via: ``fastboot set_active other``. The whole idea behind this is to allow for seamless system upgrades. Android can update the non-current slot while booted, then tell the system to boot to the other slot once the update successfully completes. This does a couple things for us: prevents the user from staring at a boot animation forever, since we can dexopt before reboot. It also prevents creating a non-booting system caused by a flash failure because if it fails the target partition won't be marked as bootable and therefore a reboot would keep the user on the current, working, slot.

* TWRP can be downloaded from here: https://goo.gl/BRpaci  Flash it to the `boot` partition with fastboot.
